- Code reusability
- Code readable
- Easy to maintain
- using Pure functions, program is more predictable and lesser changes of bugs
- Easy to test
- Mutithreading is much more easier

const sum = (a, b) => a+b

sum(2,3)

// [2,3] 4   [2,3,4]
const addNumber = (arr, n) => {
   arr.push(n);
   return arr;
} 

const addNumber = (arr, n) => {
  const newArr = [...arr, n];
   return newArr;
} 



Currying 

- You take partial inputs from user incrementally
- The advantage is better reusability of code
